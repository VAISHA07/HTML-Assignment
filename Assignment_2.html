  <P>
     I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department.Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a programmer at      Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product designed to improve      communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for Project Teams product      throughout an entire software lifecycleâ€”from initial product conception through the actual product launch.

    I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on     process SUPport for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial     Intelligence, and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
